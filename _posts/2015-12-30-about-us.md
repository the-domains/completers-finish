It
sounds cliche, but for us, running is more than a sport -- it is a 
lifestyle.  The day seems to unfold differently when it starts off with a
run, or when you know a run is waiting for you when your work is done. 
Whether it be on the streets around High Park, through the trails along
the Humber River, or at a race in another city; we find the gratitude 
in the opportunity just be outside running.  It is true -- not every one 
can run, but most can walk, and that is where it often starts.  The rest
is up to you.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0b22899c-3a93-4c50-8577-3604a56a6fcd.jpg)

Com.pleters can hardly be described as competitive,but we are determined to do our best and have fun.  All of us have a 
million things we could be doing, but we choose to do this because we 
have seen the benefit of running in our lives.  So we run for enjoyment 
with the hope that the right mix of training, rest and attitude will 
help us to reach better results every time we race.  We support each 
other, on and off the road, to meet the goals of our lives, whatever 
they may be. 

So
feel free to take a look around.  You will see that we are runners of 
all ages and abilities.  Some of us have qualified for Boston, others 
run ultra-marathons and some just like to run on the weekends. We love 
the road and the trails; the snow and the heat; the rain and the sun -- 
we find any of these better than sitting at home in front of the 
television.  

Most
of us run a couple of times per week, but Saturday and Sunday are our 
group runs, which start earlier than most, but that because we like to 
have a bite to eat in good company afterwards. 

If
you are looking for a different sort of group, then we encourage you to
find them, but if all this sounds good to you -- then come out for a run
and find out how good it feels when you get to the finish line!
